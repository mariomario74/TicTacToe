# TicTacToe
This is my X and O game that I created during my summer practice.

Simple game using picture boxes and 2D arrays(Matrices) to check the win conditions. You must add two photos and modify the source location of the X photo and O photo in the code in order for the code to work properly.

The code has the option to also check the win using tags, but I went with matrices due to the more diversity that can be done when using a matrix array.
