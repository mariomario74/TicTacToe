# TicTacToe
This is my X and O game that I created during my summer practice.

Simple game using picture boxes and 2D arrays(Matrices) to check the win conditions.

The code has the option to also check the win using tags, but I went with matrices due to the more diversity that can be done when using a matrix array.

The standalone portable version can be found here:
